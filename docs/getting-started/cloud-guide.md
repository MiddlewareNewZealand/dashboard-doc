# The Cloud

This dashboard uses firebase, firestore and cloudfunctions/run as its backend.
Data provided to the client is often synced from various third party sources into collections, with one collection able to have multiple sources. As such you will need to be able to access these collections
to observe, modify data, and edit the various functions syncing third party sources to
these collections.

:::info
Both cloud functions v1 and cloud run (cloud functions v2) are used in this system. They and are deployed/set up in different ways.
:::

# Collections

Collections can be accessed in the non-prod firestore console, or by clicking [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases/)
and clicking on the "(default)" link.

From here you can access and observe various collections and the data within. As a quick guide to key collections:

- **profile**: User data to be displayed throughout the dashboard.
- **hiring**: User data specific to the /hiring page.
- **roles**: Read/write permissions (You can re-write yours here if you are having issues).
- **config**: Static variables that the user may want, but you do not want to expose in client-side code.
- **clients**: Client data.
- **jobs**: Job data.
- **leave-requests-approved**: Approved leave requests from iPayroll.
- **leave-requests-closed**: Past leave requests from iPayroll.

# Storage

Firebase storage is used as storage buckets for non-noSQL data. It can be accesssed through the firebase
console or by clicking this link [here](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/mwnz-dashboard-nonprod/storage/)

# Cloud Functions v1

To sync data to these collections we use cloud functions which can be found in the /functions directory in the
dashboard project, or through the cloud functions 1st gen console. You can find this either through the firestore
searchbar or [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/functions)

These functions are not based off the literal `function`(s) or file names found in /functions, but on topics that call given functions. You will also likely want to edit and deploy these functions, this is how it is done:

### Edit

Better practice is to edit it on your local git repo clone. However in a pinch you can click a topic, go to source,
and edit the code for that topic there. Mind that this can cause issues if multiple topics use the same function as this
only edits the source code for that one topic.

### Deploy

Deployment is quite simple. First you want to install firebase tools in your root directory by typing the following
in your console

```console
npm i -g firebase-tools
```

and login to your account via

```
firebase login
```

:::tip
Ensure that your firebase.rc points towards non-prod, and check the version of functions/package.json
:::

Finally you can deploy your edited function! Navigate to your function directory in your console, ensure your
packages are installed, and deploy your functions via topic.

```console
# Navigate to functions dir
cd functions/
# Install node packages
npm install
# Deploy function
npm run deploy:functions:nonprod -- --[FUNCTION_NAME]
# OR deploy multiple functions
npm run deploy:functions:nonprod -- --[FUNCTION_NAME_A] --[FUNCTION_NAME_B]
```

This is just a fancy wrapper in functions/package.json that uses firebase deploy --only functions:[FUNCTION_NAME]

:::danger
DO NOT deploy all functions, but if you must:

```console
npm run deploy:functions:all:nonprod
```

:::

:::tip
Usually, there is only one function doing actual work, the rest just publish jobs and do not need to be updated. i.e iPayrollSyncLeaveRequestOnTopic vs iPayrollSyncLeaveRequestOnScheduleWeekdayHour
:::

:::warning
If you remove a field from one of the transformers, that data will remain. Similarly, if you manually remove a field, the data will not detect a change unless the data from the source changes.
:::

:::tip
If you go to the Logs tab, you can see a log of functions deployed. You can see if your functions have had
an affect in the firestore, most functions run every 10-15 minutes.
:::

# Cloud Run

Unlike cloud functions, Cloud Run functions are fully containerised. However, their package.json should only contain metadata, all of its environment should be set by functions/package.json.

You can deploy it via:

```console
# Navigate to functions dir
cd functions/
# Install node packages
npm install
# Deploy function
npm run deploy:cloudrun:nonprod -- --[DIRECTORY_NAME]
# OR deploy multiple functions
npm run deploy:cloudrun:nonprod -- --[DIRECTORY_NAME_A] --[DIRECTORY_NAME_B]
```

## These are the required boilerplate files for cloudrun services

You can note that other than the package.json, you can simple copy paste these. `deploy.cloudrun.js` is what connects the root package.json and each cloudrun service. The naming is based on the directory e.g rbac is in the ~/rbac directory and the name is as such `rbac`.

## package.json

```json
{
  "name": "dashboard-functions-rbac",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "main": "server.js", <-- what file to launch
  "config": {
    "serviceName": "rbac" <-- helps the cloudbuild.yaml and dockerfile to automatically make decisions based on the correct directory
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  }
}
```

## cloudbuild.yaml

```yaml
steps:
  - name: "gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker"
    args:
      - "build"
      - "-t"
      - "${_IMAGE_NAME}"
      - "-f"
      - "${_SERVICE_DIR}/Dockerfile"
      - "--build-arg"
      - "NODE_VERSION=${_NODE_VERSION}" # <-- acquired from base package.json
      - "--build-arg"
      - "SERVICE_DIR=${_SERVICE_DIR}"
      - "."
images:
  - "${_IMAGE_NAME}"
timeout: "1200s"
```

## Dockerfile

```dockerfile
ARG NODE_VERSION
FROM node:${NODE_VERSION}-slim

# Install curl for healthcheck
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy root package files (includes dependencies)
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install dependencies from root
RUN npm ci --omit=dev

# Copy service metadata first to read serviceName
ARG SERVICE_DIR
COPY ${SERVICE_DIR}/package.json ./service-package.json

# Copy service source files
COPY ${SERVICE_DIR}/ ./

# Expose Cloud Run default port
EXPOSE 8080

# Run as non-root
RUN groupadd -r appuser && useradd -r -g appuser appuser
RUN chown -R appuser:appuser /app
USER appuser

# Healthcheck
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:${PORT:-8080}/health || exit 1

# Start service
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
