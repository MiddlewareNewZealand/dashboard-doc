# Custom Claims

[Google custom claims](https://cloud.google.com/identity-platform/docs/how-to-configure-custom-claims) is the backbone of the dashboard rbac system and makes creating secure and detailed rbac easy. Note that front-end rbac implementation is only for the user experience, security is based on security rules restricting access to firebase/store.
