Page widgets are simply widgets that are direct representations of pages. These widgets should link to these pages, but also can/should be simplified to suit a widget format.

These often recycle components from pages, an isWidget prop can be used to conditionally format components. Width can be defaulted to the largest BREAKPOINT if width detection is dependent on something external e.g `useWidgetProperties()`
